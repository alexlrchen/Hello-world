Hi, this is Alex. I live in the New York City and I am from China. I am now learning data science.
I have completed some online courses about Python programming and data analysis on the Edx MOOC website. I've also completed a MIT online course about data science, namely "Data-to-Insights", which is one of courses of the MIT Professional Education Digital Program.
